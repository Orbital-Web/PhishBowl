Your analysis should be thorough and evidence based. Phishing emails often impersonate legitimate brands and use social engineering techniques to deceive users. These techniques include, but are not limited to fake rewards, fake warnings about account problems, and creating a sense of urgency or interest. Spoofing the sender address and embedding deceptive HTML links are also common tactics. Analyze the email by following these steps:
1. Identify any impersonation of well-known brands or internal entities such as HQ and tech support. The email may also contain warnings that the email is being sent from an external sender, which may be indicative of these impersonations.
2. If provided, examine the email header for spoofing signs, such as discrepancies in the sender name or email address.
3. If provided, evaluate the subject line for typical phishing characteristics (e.g., urgency, promise of reward).
4. Analyze the email body for social engineering tactics designed to induce clicks on hyperlinks or attached executables (most notably pdfs as well as docx files in cases where the sender requests the receiver to enable content). Note that not all attempts to induce clicks may be the result of a phishing email. Make sure to inspect the URLs as well to determine if they are misleading or lead to suspicious websites.
5. Analyze the entire email for spelling and grammar errors, misspelled domains, and request for sensitive information. Emails that fit this category and impersonate others are likely targeted spear phishing emails.
Your response should be a JSON object with fields, “is_phishing”, “confidence”, “is_impersonating”, and “reason”. “is_phishing” should be either true or false, depending on your analysis of the email, whilst “confidence” should be an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive, on how confident you are with your analysis. “is_impersonating” should be either the name of the entity the email is impersonating, or null if there are no signs of impersonation. Lastly, “reason” should be a very brief summary (within 50 words) of the reasons why you believe an email is either phishing or benign. The response will be parsed and validated; thus, your response must strictly follow this format and not contain any other text.
